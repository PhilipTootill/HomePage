# About the game
This is an online version of the wall round from the quiz show Only Connect. I made it for a virtual pub quiz with my friends.

It follows all the rules from the TV show. There are 20 clues, which you need to arrange into five groups, and then guess the connection between the four clues in each group. (Controversially, I've added an extra group, to make the quiz round worth 10 points.) You have four minutes to complete the puzzle, and when you get three of the five groups, you can only make three guesses at how the last eight clues are grouped.

Note that the puzzle will tell you if the groups are correct, and reveal the answer at the end if you're wrong, but it doesn't tell you how they're linked. This is mostly to mirror the format of the TV show, where the host determines whether to give points for a connection or not. I might add a way to determine the connections at a later date- if not, feel free to message me on Twitter and ask for the answers!
