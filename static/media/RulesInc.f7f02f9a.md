## About the game
In Rules Inc., players have one responsibility- to obey the rules at all times. If a player ever breaks a rule, they get a black mark. The winner of the game is the player who gets the fewest black marks over the course of the game. Players must try to obey the rules, while forcing their opponents to break them.

The main component is a deck of rule cards. Some cards show actions, such as drawing a card, or playing an extra rule. Other cards show restrictions which players must meet, such as a maximum or minimum hand size.

The core gameplay is simple. The game starts with two rules in play, which give players two actions they can do on their turn. Each player starts with a hand of four rule cards. On their turn, they must play at least one of these, which adds a new rule to the game, which all plays must then follow.
