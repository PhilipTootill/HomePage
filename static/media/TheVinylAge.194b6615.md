# The Vinyl Age

The Vinyl Age is a mid-weight strategy game about the history of British pop music. It's a 90 minute game for 2-4 players.

## About the game
Each player represents a different city in the UK, and builds a music scene by collecting artists and records and building up their city.

The artist cards are the core of the game. Each card is inspired by a real artist, and provides the player with a selection of actions and objectives. Generally, each card has two objectives, which correspond to different ways the act's story can end. 

For example, a progressive rock act could either sell out and immediately earn the player a lot of money, or fulfil a more difficult objective to become a legendary artist which scores bonus points at the game's end for collecting great albums.

In addition to the artist cards, a deck of event cards provides players with a range of objectives and ways to earn extra resources. These are all inspired by real records, stories and figures from the history of music.

The core mechanics of the game are resource management and set collection. Fans of different genres act as workers, enabling players to take actions and play cards. Set collecting objectives build up as the game progresses- for example, a player may score highly for each guitar act and record they release, or could score points for their punk fanbase.

The game takes inspiration from a variety of different sources. The original idea was to make a civilization game based around music history. Thematically, I wanted it to feel like *The Networks*, where each card is highly thematic, but the theme never gets in the way of the core gameplay. Tableau building games such as *Terraforming Mars* and *Race For The Galaxy* also had a strong influence on the game.

The Vinyl Age is still in fairly early development. Due to Coronavirus, I've largely been solo testing and testing it with my partner, so it still needs a lot of input from external playtesters.
