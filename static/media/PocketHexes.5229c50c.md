# About the game
This is started out as a roll and write game using a set of roleplaying dice. At first, I just wanted to make a reusable testing grid, but I ended up fleshing it out into a full solitaire game.

# How to Play

## Objective

Players place numbers into a hexagonal grid. To score a number, you must surround it with other numbers.

Example: You can score 6 points for completely surrounding a 6 with other numbers.

Each round, you can score one number. Try to score as many high valued numbers as possible!

## How a round works

The game is played in rounds. Each round, six dice are rolled, and you place three of them on your grid.

The dice are shown in the blue boxes below the grid. In order, the dice can have the following values:

- 1 to 4
- 1 to 6
- 1 to 8
- 0 to 9
- 1 to 12
- 1 to 20

## Placing a number

When adding a number to your grid, you must satisfy the following two rules. The new number must be:

- Next to an existing number.
- At least as big as all numbers it is next to.

Examples:

- The 6 cannot be placed here. It is not next to an existing number, so breaks the first rule.

- The 6 cannot be placed here. It is smaller than the 7, so breaks the second rule

![Example of how to score](__EXAMPLE_2__)

- The 4 is next to another number and at least as big as everything it touches, so may be placed here.

![Example of how to score](__EXAMPLE_3__)

There are two exceptions to these rules: 1 and 0.

- 1 can be placed anywhere which is not adjacent to an existing number.
- 0 can be placed in any free hexagon.

To place a number, first click on the dice you want to place. The hexes where it can be placed will be highlighted in orange. Clicking on any highlighted hex will place the number there.

You must place three numbers each round. After placing your third number, click 'Roll!' to get a new set of dice rolls.

## Scoring

You can score points by completely surrounding a number with other numbers. When you complete a ring of six numbers around a number, it will be highlighted in yellow. Clicking the number will then score it.

Example:

The 6 is surrounded by five other numbers.

After placing a 7 in the empty space, you can score the 6.

You can only score one number each round.

## End of the game

The game ends when you are unable to place any more dice, either by filling your board, or not being able to place them.
